1. Login Lifecycle:
- Initial State: User starts at the Login screen.
- Credential Entry: Transitions to the "Enter Credentials" state.
- Validation: On "Submit", the system moves to the "Validate" state.
- Success: If credentials match, the system transitions to "Success" and then to the final state (Redirect to Dashboard).
- Failure: If credentials are invalid, the system transitions to "Failure" and allows for a "Retry" back to the Credential Entry state.

2. Signup Lifecycle:
- Entry: Accessible from the initial application gate.
- Form Entry: Moves to the "Fill Form" state.
- Account Creation: On submission, the system enters the "Create Account" state.
- Outcome: Either transitions to "Registered" (Success) or "Form Error" (Failure).
- Loopback: In case of a "Form Error", the user can "Edit" the data to return to the "Fill Form" state.

3. AI Chatbot State Machine:
- Input: The user starts in the "Query Input" state.

5. Logging & History System:
- Manages various user logs including "Food Logs", "Ache Logs", and "Medicine Logs".
- Each log type follows a specialized path of entry, processing, and long-term storage.

- Image Processing: Follows a transition from "Insert Image" -> "Analysis Image" -> "Store Info".
- File Processing: Follows a transition from "Parse Files" -> "Store Extracted" -> "Notifications".
