Sequence Diagram Description:

1. Authentication Process:
- Login: The Patient enters their Email and Password in the Mobile App. The app sends these credentials to the Database, which returns a Login Result. If successful, a pop-up is shown, and the user is redirected to the Home View.
- Signup: The Patient fills out a Registration Form. The Mobile App sends the data to the Database to create a new user account. The Database returns a Registration Result, and a pop-up confirms the outcome.

2. AI Chatbot Interaction:
- The Patient writes a query in the Chatbot interface.
- The Mobile App sends the query to the AI service.
- The AI service processes the query, retrieves relevant documents (likely from a vector store or knowledge base), and generates an LLM-based answer.
- Simultaneously, the conversation is stored in the Database for history.
- The AI returns the response to the Mobile App, which displays it to the Patient. History is also retrievable for future context.

3. Glucose Reading Tracking:
- The Patient enters their glucose reading data.
- The Mobile App saves the new readings to the Database.
- A confirmation pop-up is displayed.
- The App can then retrieve all previous readings from the Database for visualization (charts/trends).

4. Food Log & Nutritional Analysis:
- The Patient inputs food data or uploads an image of their meal.
- The Mobile App sends this to the AI for analysis.
- The AI estimates calories and provides nutritional information.
- The Database stores this log and provides food recommendations based on the analysis.

5. Medicine Log & Reminders:
- The Patient records their medicine intake and schedule.
- The Mobile App saves this information to the Database.
- The Database triggers notification alerts to the Mobile App to remind the user of their next dose.

6. Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) Analysis:
- The Patient uploads images of their feet.
- The Mobile App sends the images to the AI for specialized analysis.
- The AI analyzes the image for signs of ulcers or complications.
- The images and results are saved in the Database.
- The final analysis results are displayed back to the user.

7. Lab Test Management:
- The Patient uploads lab test results.
- The Mobile App sends these to the AI to "Check" and "Parse" the data.
- Extracted information and the original lab results are stored in the Database.
- The AI provides recommended actions and a clinical analysis of the lab results.

8. Automated Health Alerts ("Follow Me"):
- The system monitors user data against predefined rules.
- Rule-based health care alerts are triggered and sent to the Mobile App.
- The system provides follow-up recommendations and asks subsequent health questions to the user based on their current status.
