The sequence diagram illustrates the comprehensive interaction flow within the Diamate ecosystem, starting with the authentication process where patients securely log in or sign up, triggering a series of database verifications and registration results. Once authenticated, the patient can engage with an advanced AI Chatbot; this involves sending queries that the Mobile App processes through an AI service which retrieves relevant knowledge base documents to generate intelligent LLM-based responses while simultaneously archiving the conversation history.

Beyond consultation, the system manages vital health tracking through specialized modules. Glucose readings are periodically entered by the patient and stored for long-term trend visualization, while a sophisticated Food Log module allows users to input dietary data or images for caloric estimation and nutritional analysis. Medication management is also integrated, where the app saves medicine schedules and triggers automated notification alerts to ensure patient compliance.

For more complex diagnostics, the Diamate platform facilitates Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) analysis and Lab Test management. Patients can upload foot images that are processed by high-precision AI models to detect signs of complications, with results and images stored in their health history. Similarly, lab test results are parsed and analyzed by the AI to extract clinical insights and suggest recommended actions. Finally, a proactive 'Follow Me' engine monitors all incoming user data against clinical rules to trigger real-time health alerts and subsequent follow-up questions, creating a dynamic and responsive healthcare experience.
