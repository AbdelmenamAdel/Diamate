The state diagram defines the dynamic behavior of the Diamate application, beginning with a robust Authentication Lifecycle where the system transitions from idle to credential entry. Upon submission, the application enters a validation state that leads either to a successful login and dashboard redirection or a failure state that prompts the user for a retry. A parallel signup lifecycle manages the transition from form entry to account creation, handling potential errors through an interactive edit loop that ensures data accuracy before the user is officially registered and redirected to the primary health modules.

The core of the user experience is centered around the AI Chatbot and Dashboard states. The Chatbot operates as a continuous state machine that moves from query input through processing and data retrieval to generate and display a response, eventually leading to a conversation storage state that maintains context for subsequent queries. Simultaneously, the Dashboard state focuses on data synthesis, transitioning between calculating outcome rates, saving finalized results, and rendering complex visualizations that provide the patient with a clear view of their health status.

A specialized Logging system and a multi-stage Analysis engine manage detailed health attributes across distinct states. The system handles food, ache, and medicine logs through sequential entry and processing paths. More advanced interactions are managed within the Image and File Processing states, where inputs move from initial insertion through parsing and cloud-based analysis to reach a final storage state. These processing paths feed into the Recommendations and Alerts engine, which evaluates the extracted information to trigger the final states of generating food recommendations, medicine insights, and critical healthcare alerts.
